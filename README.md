# Project Overview

This project is a PHP application designed to set up and initialize a database using a SQL schema. The application provides a simple web interface for users to execute the database setup process. It reads SQL commands from a file and executes them in the specified database.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**:
   Ensure you have a web server with PHP support. You can use platforms like XAMPP, MAMP, or your own PHP-enabled web server.

3. **Create a database**:
   Before running the application, you will need to create a new database in your MySQL server where the schema will be applied.

4. **Configure database connection**:
   Adjust the database connection settings in `config/database.php` to match your environment.

5. **Run the application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/path_to_your_project/index.php`.

## Usage

To initialize the database:
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Initialize Database" button. This action will execute the SQL commands found in `db_schema.sql` and set up the database schema.

You should see feedback regarding the status of the setup.

## Features

- Simple and clean web interface.
- Executes SQL commands from a specified file to set up the database.
- Displays clear success or error messages upon execution.

## Dependencies

Currently, this project does not use any external PHP packages, but it does utilize a basic connection file which should be included in the project for database connectivity.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.php`: The main entry point for the web application.
- `setup_database.php`: The script responsible for executing the SQL file and setting up the database.
- `config/database.php`: Contains the database connection settings.
- `db_schema.sql`: The SQL file that contains the schema for the database (not included in the provided content, please ensure it is present in your project).
